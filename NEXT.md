## What We Completed Today

✅ **Properties Table Implementation**
- Added sortable columns: Address, City, Sale Date, Sale Price, Brands, Buyer, Seller
- Clicking any column header sorts A-Z, clicking again sorts Z-A
- Removed "Action" column - entire row now clickable to view property details

✅ **Advanced Filters UI**
- Horizontal filter layout (not collapsible - always visible)
- City filter dropdown with ALL 60+ cities now loading correctly
- Brand filter dropdown
- Buyer filter dropdown (populated with buyer data)
- Seller filter dropdown (populated with seller data)
- Price filter with min/max dropdowns (preset ranges: $500k - $1B)
- Reset All button when filters active

✅ **Transaction Data Integration**
- Properties page now fetches latest transaction for each property
- Displays: transaction_date, price, buyer_name, seller_name
- 14,481 properties with transactions in database
- Buyer/Seller data successfully populated

✅ **City Dropdown Fix - RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause**: Supabase PostgREST default limit of 1000 rows was only returning first 1000 properties
- **Solution**: Implemented batched fetching (1000 rows per batch, up to 15k total)
- **Result**: All 60+ unique cities now load correctly in dropdown
- **Technical**: Used `.range(from, to)` in loop to fetch multiple batches and deduplicate cities

✅ **Next.js Cache Issue Fix**
- Cleared `.next` cache directory to resolve CSS loading issues
- Ant Design styles now loading correctly after dev server restart

## Technical Details

**City Dropdown Fix Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fetch cities in batches of 1000 to bypass PostgREST default limit
const batchSize = 1000
const batches = 15 // Up to 15k properties
for (let i = 0; i < batches; i++) {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('properties')
    .select('city')
    .eq('province', 'ON')
    .not('city', 'is', null)
    .range(i * batchSize, (i + 1) * batchSize - 1)
  // Aggregate and deduplicate
}
```

**Database Status:**
- 14,481 properties in ON province
- 60+ unique cities (all loading correctly)
- Transactions have buyer_name and seller_name populated

**Key Files Modified:**
- `/webapp/frontend/app/dashboard/properties/page.tsx` - Batched city fetching, fixed styling issues

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Test All Filters Together**
   - Verify city filter works with all cities
   - Test buyer/seller filters with populated data
   - Test price range filtering
   - Test combined filters (multiple filters at once)

2. **Performance Optimization** (if needed)
   - Monitor if batched city fetching causes slow initial load
   - Consider caching filter options in localStorage or using a dedicated endpoint

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states for filter dropdowns
   - Consider adding filter result counts
   - Evaluate filter responsiveness on mobile

## Decisions Made

- Filters always visible (not collapsible) - easier UX for essential filters
- Price dropdown shows min/max side-by-side with preset increments
- Entire table row clickable (removed "Action" column for cleaner UI)
- Using Ant Design components throughout for consistency
- Batched data fetching approach for large datasets to bypass API limits
- Disabled virtual scrolling on city dropdown (`virtual={false}`) for better compatibility
