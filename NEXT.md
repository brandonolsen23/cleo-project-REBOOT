## What We Completed Today

✅ **Properties Table Implementation**
- Added sortable columns: Address, City, Sale Date, Sale Price, Brands, Buyer, Seller
- Clicking any column header sorts A-Z, clicking again sorts Z-A
- Removed "Action" column - entire row now clickable to view property details

✅ **Advanced Filters UI**
- Horizontal filter layout (not collapsible - always visible)
- City filter dropdown (60 cities loaded from database)
- Brand filter dropdown
- Buyer filter dropdown (currently 0 buyers in data)
- Seller filter dropdown (currently 0 sellers in data)
- Price filter with min/max dropdowns (preset ranges: $500k - $1B)
- Reset All button when filters active

✅ **Transaction Data Integration**
- Properties page now fetches latest transaction for each property
- Displays: transaction_date, price, buyer_name, seller_name
- 14,481 properties with transactions in database

✅ **Git & Project Management**
- Created NEXT.md for session handoffs
- Committed and pushed all changes

## In Progress / Blocked

❌ **City Dropdown Issue**
- **Problem**: Dropdown stops scrolling at "Brampton" (only ~20 cities visible out of 60)
- **Root cause**: Ant Design Select virtual scrolling not working despite using `virtual={true}` and `options` prop
- **Tried**: Multiple approaches (Select.Option children, options prop, virtual prop, listHeight)
- **Status**: Still investigating

❌ **Buyer/Seller Data Missing**
- **Problem**: Transactions table has 0 records with buyer_name/seller_name populated
- **Impact**: Buyer and Seller filters show "No buyers/sellers in database"
- **Next step**: Need to populate transaction data with buyer/seller information from RealTrack JSON or other sources

⚠️ **Price Dropdown UX**
- Current implementation uses Ant Design Select with `popupRender`
- Works but might need refinement based on user testing

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Fix City Dropdown Scrolling**
   - Try alternative dropdown library (react-select?)
   - Or implement custom virtualized dropdown
   - Or use Ant Design AutoComplete instead of Select

2. **Populate Transaction Buyer/Seller Data**
   - Check if RealTrack JSON files have buyer/seller information
   - Run data migration to populate transactions.buyer_name and transactions.seller_name
   - Verify data appears in dropdowns after population

3. **Test All Filters**
   - Verify city filter works with all cities
   - Test buyer/seller filters once data is populated
   - Test price range filtering
   - Test combined filters

## Technical Notes

**Database Status:**
- 14,481 properties in ON province
- 60 unique cities
- Transactions linked to properties via property_id
- buyer_name and seller_name fields exist but are NULL/empty

**Console Logs Show:**
```
Loaded 60 unique cities
Loaded 0 unique buyers
Loaded 0 unique sellers
```

**Key Files Modified:**
- `/webapp/frontend/app/dashboard/properties/page.tsx` - Main properties page with filters and table

## Decisions Made

- Filters always visible (not collapsible) - easier UX for essential filters
- Price dropdown shows min/max side-by-side with preset increments
- Entire table row clickable (removed "Action" column for cleaner UI)
- Using Ant Design components throughout for consistency
