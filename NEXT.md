## What We Completed Today

‚úÖ **Properties Table Implementation**
- Added sortable columns: Address, City, Sale Date, Sale Price, Brands, Buyer, Seller
- Clicking any column header sorts A-Z, clicking again sorts Z-A
- Removed "Action" column - entire row now clickable to view property details

‚úÖ **Advanced Filters UI**
- Horizontal filter layout (not collapsible - always visible)
- City filter dropdown with ALL 60+ cities now loading correctly
- Brand filter dropdown
- Buyer filter dropdown (populated with buyer data)
- Seller filter dropdown (populated with seller data)
- Price filter with min/max dropdowns (preset ranges: $500k - $1B)
- Reset All button when filters active

‚úÖ **Transaction Data Integration**
- Properties page now fetches latest transaction for each property
- Displays: transaction_date, price, buyer_name, seller_name
- 14,481 properties with transactions in database
- Buyer/Seller data successfully populated

‚úÖ **City Dropdown Fix - RESOLVED**
- **Root Cause**: Supabase PostgREST default limit of 1000 rows was only returning first 1000 properties
- **Solution**: Implemented batched fetching (1000 rows per batch, up to 15k total)
- **Result**: All 60+ unique cities now load correctly in dropdown
- **Technical**: Used `.range(from, to)` in loop to fetch multiple batches and deduplicate cities

‚úÖ **Next.js Cache Issue Fix**
- Cleared `.next` cache directory to resolve CSS loading issues
- Ant Design styles now loading correctly after dev server restart

‚úÖ **Database Address Quality Analysis - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**
- Analyzed address normalization quality across properties table
- Discovered fundamental data quality issues preventing proper address matching
- Created comprehensive diagnosis and fix plan

## Critical Issues Discovered

### üö® Address Normalization is Broken

**Problem Summary:**
The city field contains garbage data that breaks address matching:
- Unit numbers: "Unit #24", "Unit 1", "Suite 105"
- Full street addresses: "345 King Street West", "5800 MAVIS RD"
- Sub-municipality variations: "Toronto (Scarborough)", "Hamilton (Ancaster)", "Halton Hills (Georgetown)"
- Result: 199 unique "city" values in just 1,000 properties (should be ~60 actual cities)

**Root Cause:**
RealTrack scraper (`scripts/scraper/realtrack_ingest.py`) takes raw JSON fields with ZERO validation:
```python
addr = rec.get("Address") or ""  # No parsing
city = rec.get("City") or ""     # No validation - whatever garbage is in source JSON goes into DB!
```

**Impact:**
- `address_hash` computed from wrong city values
- Brand locations may be matched to WRONG properties
- Address matching failing silently
- Users see duplicate/invalid cities in filter dropdowns
- Impossible to properly aggregate data by city

**Example Bad Data:**
```
Property ID: a2af38b7-570e-42b3-8b4f-e4b53d64e23a
Address Line 1: "9025 Airport Road"
City: "Unit 1"  ‚ùå WRONG
Canonical: "9025 AIRPORT ROAD, UNIT 1, BRAMPTON, CA"  ‚Üê Correct city is here!
```

## Technical Details

**City Dropdown Fix Implementation:**
```typescript
// Fetch cities in batches of 1000 to bypass PostgREST default limit
const batchSize = 1000
const batches = 15 // Up to 15k properties
for (let i = 0; i < batches; i++) {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('properties')
    .select('city')
    .eq('province', 'ON')
    .not('city', 'is', null)
    .range(i * batchSize, (i + 1) * batchSize - 1)
  // Aggregate and deduplicate
}
```

**Database Status:**
- 16,110 total properties in database
- 14,481 properties in ON province
- 6,015 properties have transactions linked
- 11,913 brand locations (100% matched to properties - but may be incorrect matches!)
- 12,206 property-brand links

**Address Quality Stats:**
- 100% of properties have `address_canonical` ‚úì
- 100% of properties have `address_hash` ‚úì
- 68.9% of properties have geocoding (lat/long)
- ~44 properties with unit numbers in city field (in 1k sample)
- 199 unique "city" values (should be ~60)

**Key Files Created:**
- `/scripts/analysis/analyze_address_matching.py` - Database matching analysis
- `/scripts/analysis/analyze_city_quality.py` - City data quality scan
- `/docs/ADDRESS_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 4-week fix plan
- `/scripts/analysis/address_matching_results.json` - Analysis output

**Key Files Modified:**
- `/webapp/frontend/app/dashboard/properties/page.tsx` - Batched city fetching, fixed styling issues

## Next Session Priorities

### URGENT: Address Normalization Fixes

**The 100% brand location "match rate" is misleading - we have no confidence these are matched to the CORRECT properties!**

See `/docs/ADDRESS_NORMALIZATION_PLAN.md` for full plan. Summary:

**Week 1 - Emergency Fixes (START HERE):**
1. **Fix existing data** - Extract correct city from `address_canonical` field
   - Create `scripts/fixes/fix_city_from_canonical.py`
   - Parse "9025 AIRPORT ROAD, UNIT 1, BRAMPTON, CA" ‚Üí city = "BRAMPTON"
   - Run on all 16k properties
2. **Re-compute address_hash** - After city fixes, recalculate all hashes
3. **Validate results** - Verify city dropdown shows ~60 cities, not 199

**Week 2 - Build Address Parser:**
1. Create `common/address_parser.py` - Robust Canadian address parser
   - Extract street number, name, unit from address string
   - Validate city against reference list of real ON cities
   - Handle amalgamated cities (Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa)
   - Remove sub-municipality suffixes like "(Scarborough)"
2. Add unit tests for parser

**Week 3 - Fix Ingestion Pipeline:**
1. Update `scripts/scraper/realtrack_ingest.py` to use parser
2. Add validation layer - reject records with invalid cities
3. Update any other scrapers (brand locations, etc.)

**Week 4 - Improve Matching:**
1. Multi-pass matching: exact hash ‚Üí fuzzy city ‚Üí geocoding proximity
2. Backfill any remaining unmatched brand locations
3. Validation and metrics

**Success Metrics:**
- Before: 199 "cities" in 1k properties, unit numbers in city field
- After: ~60 actual cities, 0 unit numbers, >95% correct brand-property matches

### Other Priorities (Lower Priority)

1. **Test All Filters Together**
   - Verify filters work correctly with current data
   - Note: City filter will show garbage data until normalization is fixed

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor batched city fetching performance
   - Consider caching filter options

## Decisions Made

- Filters always visible (not collapsible) - easier UX for essential filters
- Price dropdown shows min/max side-by-side with preset increments
- Entire table row clickable (removed "Action" column for cleaner UI)
- Using Ant Design components throughout for consistency
- Batched data fetching approach for large datasets to bypass API limits
- Disabled virtual scrolling on city dropdown (`virtual={false}`) for better compatibility
